## IPM Vehicle Checklist

For internal use only.

This is a checklist for technicians to complete monthly.<br>
The checklist contains three main sections for the technician to fill out<br>

* Tech and Vehicle information as well as date of inspection.
* Equipment checklist and maintenance form.
* Vehicle damage report and maintenance form.

Technicians should access their account on Tech Routes, which should be scheduled on the technician on the first of every month, and complete the form. Once information is filled out no further action is required.
